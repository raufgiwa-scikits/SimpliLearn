Here is the detailed 250-word review of the feature distribution summary shown in the table:

The MVO reviewed the feature distribution summary table to examine key input variables used in the fraud detection model and assess their statistical properties, data integrity, and discriminatory power between fraud and non-fraud classes. The purpose of this table is to validate that important predictors are well-behaved, interpretable, and statistically significant for separating fraudulent behavior from legitimate transactions. This review is also essential for identifying any variable instability or data quality issues that may introduce model risk.

The table includes frequency and timing features such as all_freq_last_days_15, time_recent_event_seconds, and profile_sum_avg_mth_bal. For example, time_recent_event_seconds shows extreme variability with a standard deviation of over 217M seconds and a difference in percentiles between fraud and non-fraud segments exceeding 10%, suggesting it captures distinct behavioral delays for fraudulent users. fring_ph_num_total_cust_num_count_last_days_30 also shows strong separation, with a fraud percentile of 75th = 60, while the non-fraud equivalent is significantly lower, highlighting elevated fraud density in multi-account associations. On the other hand, some features like all_freq_last_days_3 and all_freq_last_days_7 show overlapping distributions with limited discriminatory gain.

Merits: Key features are diverse, interpretable, and behaviorally aligned with fraud patterns. Time-based features, in particular, offer strong separation.
Demerits: Some features have high missingness (e.g., profile_sum_avg_mth_bal with ~14% missing), which could affect model robustness.
Exceptions: Outliers in time_since_cardorder_last_days_30 may require winsorization.
Recommendations: Apply missing value imputation, monitor feature drift post-deployment, and regularly validate percentile separation across time windows.

Here is the 250-word performance and risk review of the scatterplot visualizations in Figure B2: Feature vs. Model Score Plots:

The MVO reviewed Figure B2: Feature vs. Score Distribution Scatterplots to assess the alignment between individual predictor variables and the fraud model’s output score, and to evaluate the separation patterns between fraud and non-fraud observations. The purpose of this figure is to visually validate the monotonicity and discriminatory structure of key features used in the fraud model, helping to ensure model explainability, detect possible non-linear patterns, and highlight outliers or variable weaknesses that may affect performance.

The scatterplots present nine top-ranked variables such as all_freq_last_days_15, time_recent_event_seconds, and fring_ph_num_total_cust_num_count_last_days_30. A consistent pattern across most features is observed: fraud observations (red points) are clustered at low feature values and receive high model scores near 1.0, indicating strong positive alignment. Features like all_freq_last_days_15 and all_freq_last_days_30 show clear upward score trends at lower values, then quickly plateau—indicating model responsiveness to low event frequency. profile_sum_avg_mth_bal and time_recent_event_seconds exhibit heavy-tailed distributions, but again, fraud signals are tightly packed in low-value ranges with high associated scores. time_since_cardorder_last_days_30 shows a scattered fraud pattern, suggesting weaker influence or interaction dependence.

Merits: Strong feature-score alignment, visual separability of fraud, and robust low-value signal concentration.
Demerits: Extreme skew in features like time_recent_event_seconds may require transformation or binning.
Exceptions: Weaker score-response seen in time_since_cardorder_last_days_30.
Recommendations: Regular monitoring of these patterns post-deployment, potential winsorization of extreme values, and enhanced model explanation tools for weaker features.

Here is the 250-word performance and robustness review of the perturbation sensitivity table in Figure B3: Diagnosed Perturbed Data across Budgets:

The MVO reviewed Figure B3: Diagnosed Perturbed Data across Time and Observation Budgets to evaluate the sensitivity and robustness of the fraud model’s output to variations in key input features. The purpose of this table is to quantify how perturbations—applied either over time (tim) or over observations (obs)—affect model predictions. This is crucial for stress-testing the model and understanding the resilience of key features under operational noise, data drift, or adversarial manipulation.

Statistically, several features show increasing impact on model outputs with growing perturbation budget. For instance, all_freq_last_days_15 sees its average influence rise from 0.091 at 0.2 tim to 0.262 at 1.0 tim, and from 0.305 at 0.6 obs to 0.391 at 1.0 obs. This suggests that score sensitivity to changes in recent frequency is relatively high, especially with observation noise. Similarly, all_freq_last_days_7 and all_freq_last_days_3 follow the same trend, revealing vulnerability in temporal frequency signals. Conversely, profile_sum_avg_mth_bal shows extremely stable values (0.964) across all perturbation levels, indicating that it is largely invariant and likely over-dominated or under-utilized by the model. time_since_cardorder_last_days_30 appears to have limited influence (≤ 0.065), raising questions about its utility.

Merits: Provides a transparent view of model fragility and feature relevance under uncertainty.
Demerits: Exposes certain frequency-based features as high-risk to noise.
Exceptions: profile_sum_avg_mth_bal may be underweighted or improperly scaled.
Recommendations: Rebalance feature weights, apply regularization, and consider feature dropout testing during training to improve generalization.

Here is the 250-word performance and risk review of Figure B4: Data Perturbation Diagnosis Plots:

The MVO reviewed Figure B4: Data Perturbation Diagnosis Plots to assess the robustness of individual features under varying perturbation budgets. The figure contains two key views: (A) shows the raw percentage of times a variable is perturbed given an observation, while (B) shows the raw percentage of observations for which a variable is perturbed. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the resilience of input features to changes and to identify which variables are most susceptible to noise or model sensitivity—key considerations for ensuring model stability and fairness in production.

From the left plot (A), the variable profile_sum_avg_mth_bal sharply reaches a perturbation impact rate of 96.4% even at low budgets, indicating it is disproportionately targeted by perturbation due to either high importance or instability. fring_ph_num_total_cust_num_count_last_days_30 also displays a moderately steep climb, leveling off at around 38.6%. Conversely, time_since_cardorder_last_days_30 remains nearly flat across budgets, suggesting very low susceptibility and limited model reliance. The right plot (B) reinforces these insights: the same two features dominate the proportion of affected observations, while variables like all_freq_last_days_15 and time_recent_event_seconds show moderate vulnerability that increases gradually with budget.

Merits: Effectively highlights high-impact and low-impact features for model auditing.
Demerits: Imbalance in feature susceptibility suggests the model may over-rely on a few volatile variables.
Exceptions: Features with flat perturbation profiles may contribute little to decision logic.
Recommendations: Consider normalization or regularization of over-sensitive features, feature decorrelation during retraining, and incorporation of adversarial robustness tests in future development cycles.
