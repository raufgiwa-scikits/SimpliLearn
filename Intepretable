Here’s a detailed technical and statistical analysis based on Table 5.3-2: Performance for combined in-time and out-of-time data period (Mar–Jul 2024) and the accompanying narrative:

Purpose and Scope of Table 5.3-2

To further investigate model robustness and potential overfitting, the MVO generated Table 5.3-2, which presents key performance metrics across different temporal splits—In-Time, Out-of-Time, Validation, and Training datasets. The primary goal is to compare the model’s predictive behavior across these segments using various metrics: ROC AUC, AUC PR, KS, Discovery Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and fractional changes in performance relative to training data.

Statistical and Technical Insights
	1.	Fraud Rate Stability ([S%]):
	•	The fraud rate remains stable at around 12.0–12.2% across all datasets. This suggests that class balance is maintained consistently, eliminating class imbalance as a confounding factor for performance shifts.
	2.	ROC AUC:
	•	Range: 0.951 (Valid) to 0.962 (Train)
	•	Very minor drop of ~1.1% from Train to Valid and Out-of-Time.
	•	Indicates excellent generalization ability, as ROC AUC is stable.
	3.	AUC PR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve):
	•	Range: 0.297 (Valid) to 0.433 (Train)
	•	Notable degradation in AUC PR between Train (0.433) and Valid (0.297), and also Out-of-Time (0.318).
	•	f(AUC_PR) values are negative, especially -0.313 for Valid, signaling potential overfitting in capturing rare class (fraud) precision.
	4.	KS Statistic (Kolmogorov–Smirnov):
	•	Range: 0.766 (Out-of-Time) to 0.806 (Train)
	•	Stable across datasets with minor deviation (approx. 4–5% range). Indicates the model’s discriminative power is preserved across time partitions.
	5.	FPR (False Positive Rate):
	•	Values range narrowly from 827.295 to 830.884.
	•	Stable, reinforcing that the model’s error rate in labeling non-fraudulent cases as fraud has not fluctuated much.
	6.	Fractional Changes (f(x)):
	•	f(ROC_AUC): Minor changes, ≤ -0.011, indicating ROC AUC is stable.
	•	f(AUC_PR): Large negative values, particularly for validation (-0.313) and out-of-time (-0.049), suggesting degradation in rare event precision.
	•	f(KS): Also mildly negative (-0.046 in Valid), suggesting KS remains relatively robust.

Performance Interpretation and Risk Mitigation
	•	AUC_PR degradation is the standout concern. This metric is sensitive to class imbalance and directly reflects the model’s ability to distinguish minority class instances (fraud).
	•	While ROC AUC and KS are stable, the AUC PR sensitivity flags potential overfitting in rare event modeling.
	•	The negative shift in AUC PR, especially in validation data, could imply the model memorized the training fraud patterns instead of generalizing.

Mitigation Strategies:
	•	Reassess feature importance drift between Train and Valid datasets.
	•	Apply stronger regularization techniques (L1/L2).
	•	Consider rebalancing techniques (SMOTE, downsampling) or cost-sensitive learning.
	•	Use ensemble calibration (e.g., stacking with logistic calibration) to improve generalization of minority class detection.

Conclusion

From Table 5.3-2, the model shows good overall stability in ROC AUC and KS, but significant AUC PR degradation in unseen data partitions. While this does not invalidate the model, it indicates potential weaknesses in rare-event (fraud) detection. Continuous monitoring, robustness testing (e.g., perturbation or adversarial shifts), and recalibration are recommended to address generalization risks.
