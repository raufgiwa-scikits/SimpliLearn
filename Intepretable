Recommendations
	1.	Elevate CIV, EMAIL, and PHONE-related events in fraud rules or model-based alerts.
	2.	Conduct residual analysis and misclassification review on low-AUC-PR events (e.g., CHECK_ORDER, ADDRESS_CHANGE).
	3.	Explore event-level calibration or threshold optimization, especially where AUC-PR differs significantly from ROC AUC.
	4.	Use this breakdown to create fraud typology-specific monitoring dashboards.

Conclusion

This AUC-PR comparison underscores the model’s varying efficacy across fraud typologies, with notable success in communication-related fraud (email/phone/PIN) and weaker performance in operational or administrative changes. It validates earlier numeric findings and supports differentiated treatment of event types in deployment and monitoring.
