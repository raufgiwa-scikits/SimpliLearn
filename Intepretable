Purpose of Table 5-12
The table presents Population Stability Index (PSI) values across various perturbation sizes (0.1 to 0.7), helping evaluate how sensitive the final model's score distribution is to changes in feature values. PSI serves as a proxy for measuring robustness — with lower values indicating higher score stability and reduced likelihood of performance drift under minor distributional shifts.

Technical and Statistical Analysis
The perturbation sizes simulate small to moderate changes in the top 5 predictive features (via quantile shifts).

Each row in the table shows PSI metrics (mean, min, 25th percentile, median/50th percentile, 75th percentile, max) for a given perturbation level.

Across all perturbation sizes, the minimum PSI remains 0.0000, indicating at least one feature shift caused no discernible impact on score distribution.

As perturbation increases:

The mean PSI increases gradually from 0.0001 (at 0.1) to 0.0164 (at 0.7).

The max PSI grows from 0.0003 to 0.0468, showing the model becomes increasingly sensitive to larger perturbations.

The 75th percentile PSI grows from 0.0000 to 0.0243, reflecting more widespread sensitivity at higher perturbation.


Perturbation	Mean PSI	50th % (Median)	Max PSI
0.1	0.0001	0.0000	0.0003
0.4	0.0045	0.0002	0.0124
0.7	0.0164	0.0108	0.0468
Insights and Inference
The results show a controlled increase in PSI with increasing perturbation, indicating gradual sensitivity — a desirable sign of a well-regularized model.

Up to a perturbation size of 0.3, the mean PSI remains below 0.003 — suggesting excellent robustness within moderate distributional shifts.

Only at 0.7 perturbation does PSI exceed 0.01, and the maximum reaches 0.0468 — still well below typical alert thresholds (commonly PSI > 0.1 is considered significant drift).

These statistics affirm the model's strong resilience to distributional drift in top features, reducing concern for performance volatility in deployment.

Potential Risks and Mitigation
Risk: For rare but extreme data shifts (like perturbation size > 0.6), score instability could marginally increase.

Mitigation:

Continuous monitoring using PSI on production data.

Dynamic recalibration or re-training policies if PSI exceeds acceptable thresholds.

Conclusion
The perturbation-based robustness evaluation confirms that the model is well-regularized and stable under realistic input shifts.

The model’s score distribution is minimally impacted by small to moderate perturbations, reinforcing its deployment readiness.

Here is a detailed review and interpretation of the robustness metrics presented in the image, particularly focusing on Table 5-13, Table 5-14, and Figure 5.3.

Purpose of Tables and Figures
Table 5-13: Presents the benchmark PSI score (0.0125), derived from comparing March 2024 scores with those from April–May 2024, to establish a threshold for acceptable model score drift.

Table 5-14: Summarizes average AUC degradation across different perturbation sizes, highlighting the impact of data perturbation on model discrimination performance.

Figure 5.3: Visualizes the relationship between perturbation size, AUC, and PSI using box plots.

Technical and Statistical Analysis
Benchmark PSI Interpretation (Table 5-13):
PSI = 0.0125 is treated as the tolerance level for normal fluctuations in real-world data.

Perturbation sizes ≤ 0.4 produce PSI values below this benchmark, implying that these levels of change are acceptable and resemble natural variation in feature distribution.

Model Performance under Perturbation (Table 5-14):

Perturb Size	Avg AUC	AUC Degradation
0.1	0.949	-0.16%
0.2	0.947	-0.44%
0.3	0.944	-0.77%
0.4	0.940	-1.13%
0.5	0.936	-1.54%
0.6	0.962	+1.11%
0.7	0.927	-2.47%
Original	0.951	–
Minimal drop in AUC (<1%) for perturbation sizes up to 0.3 signifies that the ranking power remains strong under mild perturbations.

The spike at 0.6 might be due to noise structure aligning better with model fit, but the degradation at 0.7 (-2.47%) confirms the model's boundary of robustness.

Visual Patterns (Figure 5.3):
The AUC box plot shows a gradual decline in central tendency and tighter spread until 0.5, then sharp variance at 0.7.

The PSI box plot correlates with this, remaining flat and low until 0.3–0.4, after which PSI rises noticeably — affirming the threshold conclusion drawn from Table 5-13.

Insights and Implications
Robustness Threshold: The model maintains both PSI and AUC stability up to perturbation size 0.3–0.4, which aligns with real-world data drift tolerance.

Operational Stability: The model's ranking and score output are reliably consistent under normal to moderately shifted input features.

Exception Handling: For perturbation sizes ≥0.5, performance drift may exceed natural variability, indicating a potential trigger for model review or retraining.

Conclusion
The combined findings of Tables 5-13, 5-14, and Figure 5.3 confirm that:

The model exhibits strong robustness to minor data shifts.

It meets expectations for deployment in real-world environments, where small fluctuations in input features are common.

Perturbation analysis complements overfitting control techniques to certify the model’s resilience and reliability in production.
