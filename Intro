Thank you for sharing the image. Here's a detailed analysis report of the performance plots shown in Figure 5-3-4 for both In-Time (Mar–May 2024) and Out-of-Time (Jun–Jul 2024) datasets:

Purpose of Figure 5-3-4
The goal of this figure is to provide a side-by-side comparative performance evaluation of a fraud detection model across different event types (e.g., address change, password change) by analyzing model metrics across score cutoffs, both during the model training window (in-time) and validation window (out-of-time). This supports robustness checks and overfitting diagnostics.

Technical & Statistical Summary
(A) DR (Detection Rate) and (B) FPR (False Positive Rate) Comparison
DR declines monotonically as cutoff scores increase, which is expected.

FPR is very low near top cutoffs, consistent with a good-performing fraud model.

Some drift is visible across time — out-of-time DR curves are generally flatter, indicating slightly weaker detection.

(C) KS Comparison
KS scores are highest around score percentiles 0.1–0.2.

In-time KS curves are steeper, indicating stronger model separation during training.

Out-of-time shows more variance across event types, suggesting potential temporal instability in fraud patterns.

(D) Interval Fraud Rate Comparison
Shows a linear or exponential rise across score percentiles.

Out-of-time distribution rises more gradually, which may suggest score leakage or less sharply distinguishable fraud signals.

(E) ROC and (F) Dollar Loss Distribution
ROC curves exhibit good AUCs in both windows (>0.9 in many cases), yet in-time remains superior.

Dollar loss distributions highlight heavy-tailed loss values in low-score buckets—indicating need for risk-calibrated thresholds.

(G) AUC-PR Curve
Strong performance in in-time (PR AUC ~0.6–0.75 for some events).

Drop in out-of-time AUC-PR, with steeper decline for some categories like CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE or CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE.

Performance and Risk Implications
Model Strengths
High ROC and PR-AUC scores indicate solid fraud signal separation.

Low FPR at top-score bins indicates the model is conservative and avoids over-flagging.

KS, ROC, and dollar loss metrics together indicate effective risk prioritization.

Potential Weaknesses
Temporal drift: Drop in out-of-time metrics suggests fraud pattern shifts or seasonality.

Event-type instability: Certain categories degrade more rapidly (e.g., password or phone changes).

High-value fraud in lower percentiles could indicate missed high-impact fraud instances.

Mitigation Strategies
Retrain or recalibrate the model on more recent data.

Perform drift detection monthly per event type.

Apply event-type-specific thresholding or ensemble layering to counter distributional shifts.

Consider cost-sensitive learning or economic-weighted loss functions to boost performance in high-dollar fraud segments.

Summary of Merits and Demerits
Merits:

Robust in-time performance.

Multi-metric evaluation supports interpretability.

Differentiates performance by event type.

Demerits:

Performance degradation in out-of-time window.

May need more frequent retraining or adaptive modeling.

Potentially misses high-loss cases in low-score areas.

Exceptions and Recommendations
Exceptions:

CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE and CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE show disproportionate decline in PR-AUC and dollar loss detection.

Recommendations:

Increase monitoring on underperforming event types.

Periodically validate scoring distributions and realign thresholds.

Supplement the model with anomaly-based or unsupervised methods for edge cases.

Thank you for the updated image of Figure 5-3-4, which presents a refined layout of model performance plots across triggering events, now extended for in-time (Mar–May 2024) and out-of-time (Jun–July 2024) datasets. Below is an updated and more detailed analysis report to support performance tracking and validation strategy.

Model Performance Analysis Report: Triggering Event Comparison
Purpose of Figure
This figure aims to assess model performance stability across different fraud-triggering events. The figure contrasts In-Time vs. Out-of-Time scores to evaluate the robustness, calibration, and generalization of the model.

Insights from Metrics
(A) DR (Detection Rate) Comparison
DR curves steeply decline, especially for top-decile bins, indicating effective prioritization of high-risk transactions.

In-time DRs are uniformly higher than out-of-time, showing some overfitting or shift in fraud patterns.

Degradation in events like CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE and SUSPENDED_PSWD_CHANGE suggests temporal instability.

(B) FPR (False Positive Rate) Comparison
Sharp drop after top score bins; most non-fraud is correctly excluded.

Out-of-time FPR slightly higher, suggesting increased noise or weaker discrimination.

Flatness post 10th percentile means misclassification risk is well-contained in the lower score ranges.

(C) KS Comparison
KS values peak around early score bins (0.7–0.9), indicating effective separability.

Out-of-time KS curves shift downward, revealing weaker rank-ordering or covariate drift in those windows.

(D) Interval Fraud Rate Comparison
Linear/exponential rise toward higher score cutoffs suggests model captures risk concentration effectively.

Out-of-time interval fraud rates grow less steeply, a sign of calibration drift or diminished event predictiveness.

(E) ROC Comparison
All ROC curves lie well above random baseline, showing strong true positive rates.

In-time ROC AUCs approach 0.95+, while out-of-time exhibits mild drops, confirming slight performance decay.

(F) Dollar Loss Distributions
High-value losses concentrated in high-score bins—validating model’s economic prioritization.

Out-of-time losses show density broadening, with minor leakage into mid-score bins—possible underestimation of future risk.

(G) AUC-PR Curve Comparison
Steep falloff in precision in low-recall zones due to class imbalance.

Notable reduction in PR-AUC for out-of-time, especially for CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE and CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE.

Model Strengths
Excellent score concentration in high-risk bins.

Effective rank-ordering by cutoff percentile.

Strong economic alignment between fraud likelihood and dollar loss.

AUC-ROC and KS performance are consistently high, even under distributional shift.

Model Weaknesses
Performance degrades slightly but systematically out-of-time—indicative of concept drift or latent feature decay.

Specific event types like CUSTOMER_PASSWORD_CHANGE and CARD_ORDER_CHANGE show uneven generalization.

Dollar loss risk appears more diffuse in out-of-time, risking unflagged high-cost frauds.

Risk Mitigation & Monitoring
Drift detection tools (e.g., PSI, KS drift tests) per event type.

Regular recalibration of thresholds—especially for high-drift events.

Supplement model with adaptive thresholds or event-specific submodels.

Consider ensemble voting between in-time and retrained out-of-time variants.

Merits vs Demerits

Merits	Demerits
Strong score separation (high KS, ROC AUC)	Noticeable degradation in out-of-time event AUC-PR
Economic alignment (fraud cost concentrated)	Some high-value fraud leaks into lower score buckets
Reliable performance across most events in-time	Specific triggers show unstable performance over time
Exceptions
CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE, CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE—high volatility in PR and KS.

Out-of-time dollar losses show unexpected tail risk in mid-score bins.

Recommendations
Recalibrate model quarterly or based on drift alarms.

Introduce event-specific thresholds with cost-benefit optimization.

Consider fraud signature tracking to understand event-level fraud pattern drift.

Extend monitoring framework to include dynamic event classification risk tracking.

Distinguish between in-time and out-of-time
ChatGPT said:
In the context of model validation and performance analysis, in-time and out-of-time refer to how the evaluation data is temporally related to the training period. Here’s a clear distinction:

1. In-Time Data
Definition: Data that falls within the same time window used for model training and calibration.

Purpose: Used to evaluate how well the model fits the data it was trained on.

Characteristics:

Reflects the same distribution, fraud behavior, and covariate patterns as the training data.

Typically shows better performance (higher AUC, lower FPR) due to model optimization.

Overfitting, if any, is more likely to be revealed by high in-time performance but poor out-of-time results.

2. Out-of-Time Data
Definition: Data from a different future time window, not seen by the model during training or tuning.

Purpose: Tests the model’s ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Characteristics:

Mimics real-world deployment conditions.

Subject to concept drift (fraud patterns, customer behavior, feature distributions may change).

Often shows degraded performance, but it reflects true robustness and stability.

Practical Use in Your Figure 5-3-4

Data Type	Period	Shown in Figure Title	Purpose
In-Time	Mar – May 2024	Left-side plots (yellow bar section I)	Assess performance during model training
Out-of-Time	Jun – Jul 2024	Right-side plots (yellow bar section II)	Assess generalization after deployment
In summary:

In-Time = how well your model learned.

Out-of-Time = how well your model generalizes.

To distinguish between in-time and out-of-time plots in your Figure 5-3-4, here is a breakdown based on visual layout, interpretation, and analytical purpose:

1. Visual Layout

Feature	In-Time Plots	Out-of-Time Plots
Position on Figure	Left half (Section I, yellow title bar)	Right half (Section II, yellow title bar)
Period Covered	March – May 2024	June – July 2024
Legend Indicator	Legend ends with “In-Time”	Legend ends with “Out-of-Time”
Metric Panels	A to G on the left	A to G on the right
2. Plot Behavior and Interpretation

Metric Panel	In-Time (Mar–May)	Out-of-Time (Jun–Jul)
(A) DR	Steep drop at high cutoffs – strong detection at top scores	Flatter – reduced ability to distinguish fraud
(B) FPR	Low FPR – model avoids many false alarms	Slightly higher FPR in top scores – drift or misclassification
(C) KS	High KS values – good rank ordering	Lower KS – indicates temporal decay or weaker discrimination
(D) IFR	Fraud rate sharply increases with score	Smoother slope – model less effective at ranking by risk
(E) ROC	AUCs close to 1.0 – near-perfect separation	AUCs drop modestly – reflects concept drift
(F) Loss	Dollar losses sharply peaked in high-score bins	Broader, more dispersed loss – misranking of costly fraud cases
(G) PR	High AUC-PR in many events (esp. ACCOUNT_REL_CHANGE, etc.)	AUC-PR drops for some events (e.g. PHONE_CHANGE, PASSWORD_CHANGE)
3. Analytical Purpose

Aspect	In-Time	Out-of-Time
Model Fit Evaluation	Tests how well the model performs on training-era data	Tests how well the model performs on future data
Bias Detection	Useful for detecting overfitting or feature leakage	Useful for identifying concept drift or lack of robustness
Business Decision Relevance	Helps establish performance baselines	Guides thresholding, risk tolerance, and retraining strategy in deployment
Summary
In-time plots typically look cleaner and stronger, but may overestimate performance.

Out-of-time plots reflect the true robustness of your model and are critical for deployment validation.

Compare triggering events between in-time and out-of-time  plots
ChatGPT said:
Here is a structured comparison of triggering events across in-time and out-of-time plots in Figure 5-3-4. The goal is to assess which event types remain stable and which degrade significantly between the two periods (Mar–May 2024 vs. Jun–July 2024).

Triggering Event Comparison: In-Time vs. Out-of-Time

Triggering Event	In-Time Performance	Out-of-Time Performance	Observations / Risk Signals
CUST_ACCOUNT_REL_CHANGE	Strong DR, KS, PR AUC; low FPR and tight dollar loss concentration	Maintains decent DR and PR AUC; slight dip in KS	Stable event across time; good candidate for long-term reliance
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_CHANGE	Performs well in all metrics (DR, KS, ROC, PR AUC); loss concentration is sharp	Minor degradation in PR AUC; dollar loss a bit more dispersed	Mild decay, but still fairly robust
CARD_ORDER_CHANGE	Strong in-time PR AUC and DR	Steep performance drop in PR AUC and KS	Notable degradation; monitor for fraud tactic shifts
CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE	Average DR/KS; ROC looks decent; some skew in loss distribution	Severe PR AUC drop; DR flattens; dollar loss diffuses	Significant out-of-time weakness; should be flagged for close tracking
CUSTOMER_PSWD_CHANGE	Good in ROC and PR AUC, moderate DR; clean loss profile	ROC remains ok, but DR and PR AUC drop significantly	Drift suspected; retrain or recalibrate detection thresholds
SUSPENDED_PSWD_CHANGE	Good AUC-PR, strong loss localization, high KS	Losses spread wider; DR/KS flatten; PR AUC falls	Weakening pattern; monitor and potentially isolate in a dedicated model path
CUSTOMER_ACCT_PIN_CHANGE	Strong ROC and PR; top bins show good DR and high fraud rate	DR and PR drop moderately; some tail losses occur outside top bins	Mild degradation; generally safe but keep under observation
CUSTOMER_EMAIL_CHANGE	High KS and DR; solid loss prioritization	Slight loss leakage; PR AUC drops in later bins	Performance erosion is visible; reinforce with recent data
CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE	Among worst performing even in in-time; low DR/PR AUC	Further drop in DR, poor loss discrimination	Consistently weak; may require event reclassification or hybrid detection approach
Summary of Observations
Consistently Stable Events
CUST_ACCOUNT_REL_CHANGE

CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_CHANGE

CUSTOMER_EMAIL_CHANGE (moderate drop but manageable)

These events show strong robustness and generalization, with limited performance drift.

Degrading Events Needing Attention
CARD_ORDER_CHANGE

CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE

CUSTOMER_PSWD_CHANGE

SUSPENDED_PSWD_CHANGE

CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE

These show significant decline in out-of-time detection quality, with poorer AUC-PR, dispersed dollar loss, and flattened DR curves—suggesting temporal drift, change in fraudster behavior, or model overfitting.

Recommendations
Monitor high-drift events with drift detection (PSI, population stability).

Segment decaying events into separate models or apply adaptive learning.

Threshold Adjustment: Re-tune detection thresholds for decaying events to minimize missed fraud.

Event Clustering: Group similar weak events for ensemble or specialized feature design.

Here is a summary report based on the in-time and out-of-time triggering event comparisons from Figure 5-3-4:

Summary Report on Triggering Event Stability Across Time Windows
Model Performance Comparison: In-Time (Mar–May 2024) vs. Out-of-Time (Jun–July 2024)
Figure Reference: 5-3-4 | Fraud Detection Model Evaluation

Purpose of Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to assess the robustness and temporal stability of a fraud detection model across multiple triggering event types, by comparing performance metrics over two periods:

In-Time: March to May 2024 (training-aligned data),

Out-of-Time: June to July 2024 (future validation period).

The performance plots include metrics such as Detection Rate (DR), False Positive Rate (FPR), KS, Interval Fraud Rate, ROC, PR AUC, and Dollar Loss Distribution.

Key Findings
Event-Specific Stability

Stable Events:
CUST_ACCOUNT_REL_CHANGE, CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_CHANGE, and CUSTOMER_EMAIL_CHANGE maintained strong performance across both time periods. These events showed high AUC-ROC, stable PR AUC, and concentrated dollar loss in high-risk bins, indicating reliable model generalization.

Unstable Events:
CARD_ORDER_CHANGE, CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE, CUSTOMER_PASSWORD_CHANGE, and CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE demonstrated significant deterioration in out-of-time performance. These events showed reduced detection rates, flatter fraud rate growth, lower PR AUC scores, and a concerning spread of dollar losses outside top score bins.

Temporal Drift Observations

Out-of-time KS and PR curves consistently fell below their in-time counterparts, confirming model performance decay for several events. This suggests covariate shift, changing fraud tactics, or feature effectiveness loss over time.

Dollar loss distributions in out-of-time data became more diffuse, especially for high-risk events, indicating increased likelihood of costly fraud escaping detection.

Performance Strengths

The model retained strong overall ROC performance (AUC > 0.9 for most events), and top score bins still captured a high proportion of fraud.

In-time plots confirmed good model calibration and risk ranking alignment with economic cost (loss).

Risks & Implications
Events like CUSTOMER_PHONE_CHANGE and CHECK_ORDER_CHANGE present high model risk due to declining precision and dollar loss misallocation.

Model thresholds optimized on in-time data may be ineffective in production, leading to missed fraud or false positives.

Recommendations
Continuous Monitoring: Implement real-time drift detection tools to track changes in event-level feature distributions and fraud behavior.

Threshold Recalibration: Adjust cutoff thresholds dynamically based on recent out-of-time performance for volatile events.

Event-Specific Modeling: For events with severe degradation, consider retraining separate submodels or ensemble strategies.

Enhanced Data Augmentation: Incorporate simulated fraud patterns and synthetic examples to improve out-of-time generalization.

Conclusion
The model shows strong baseline performance during its training window but requires proactive monitoring and periodic adjustments to maintain accuracy under real-world conditions. By focusing on unstable triggering events and incorporating temporal validation feedback into model governance, the fraud detection framework can remain resilient and effective.
