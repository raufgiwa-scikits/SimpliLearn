**Subject:** Reference Letter Request for NIW Petition

Hi Jie,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently in the process of applying for a National Interest Waiver (NIW). As part of the application, Ogletree, the vendor handling immigration cases for Wells Fargo employees, has requested that I provide reference letters from key individuals, including my former employer/PhD advisor, an independent professional, a manager, and a skip-level manager. These letters, which are not confidential, will be submitted by the petitioner (myself) to the USCIS through the vendor’s web portal: [VISATrax](https://visatrax.com). 

My profile has been set up on this platform, and I have already uploaded several documents, including recommendation letters from my PhD advisor, passport, and I-94 card. However, I still require four crucial letters to strengthen my application. An endorsement from you would significantly enhance my case with the USCIS.

Given the importance of these letters, having three strong recommendations will greatly bolster my application, while a weaker set could potentially harm it. 

Therefore, I kindly ask if you would consider providing a recommendation letter for my NIW petition. I have attached a draft for your convenience, which you may edit as you see fit.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
