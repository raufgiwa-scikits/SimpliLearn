Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,

Letter of Recommendation

I am writing to provide my passionate recommendation for Saheed Adedamola Adewuyi’s
application to the Ph.D. program in Informatics at the University of South Carolina for the
upcoming Spring term. I have had the pleasure of knowing Saheed for about nine years, during
which time I have witnessed his unwavering dedication to academics, exceptional problem-
solving skills, and his potential as a researcher. Our association began during his graduate studies
at Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, where we often collaborated on solving complex
research puzzles in the lab. Saheed consistently demonstrated his sharp intellect and ability to
tackle quantitative challenges with remarkable aptitude.
Saheed&#39;s academic journey has been marked by his strong inclination towards Health
Informatics. His M.Sc. thesis on &quot;Development of a High-precision Deep Learning Model for
Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting&quot; was a testament to his technical abilities and
innovative thinking. Additionally, his ongoing research projects, which include the development
of models for managing ischemic heart disease and simulating myocardial infarction in tropical
regions, further underscore his dedication to applying informatics in the healthcare domain. His
published works, as well as his ongoing projects, reflect his commitment to advancing
knowledge in this field.
Given his academic background and research potential, I strongly believe that Saheed would be a
valuable addition to your Ph.D. program. His drive for knowledge, combined with his experience
and expertise, makes him well-suited to contribute meaningfully to the academic community at
the University of South Carolina. However, Saheed comes from a low-income background, and
securing a graduate fellowship or assistantship would be crucial in ensuring his success in the

program. Such support would not only alleviate his financial burden but also allow him to fully
dedicate himself to his research and academic pursuits.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Saheed Adewuyi for admission to your Ph.D.
program in Informatics. His potential for groundbreaking research, coupled with his passion for
Health Informatics, positions him as an ideal candidate for your program. I am confident that he
will excel in your academic environment and contribute significantly to the field of Informatics.
Thank you for considering his application. Please feel free to contact me if you require any
further information.
Sincerely,

Rauf Giwa
