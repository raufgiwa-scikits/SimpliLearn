The image you’ve shared outlines key details related to model robustness, metrics, and performance comparison for different models. Here’s a breakdown of the information presented:

Key Definitions and Metrics:

	•	Robustness: Defined as the ability of a model to maintain stable output or performance in the presence of small noise or changes in covariates.
	•	Metrics:
	•	ArPPV (Adjusted Partial Positive Predictive Value)
	•	Perturbed AUC (Area Under the Curve)
	•	Spearman Rank Correlation (Used to assess how well the relationship between variables can be described using a monotonic function)

Models Compared:

	1.	LightGBM_lob: The final model by the Center of Excellence (CoE).

The image you’ve shared presents a performance benchmark from the Center of Excellence (CoE), comparing different machine learning models across various segments and metrics.

Key Components:

Segments:

	1.	Established_DDA: This segment seems to include accounts with a more established Direct Deposit Account (DDA) history.
	2.	No_Low_DDA: This segment likely refers to accounts with no or low DDA activity.

Scores & Metrics:

	1.	KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic): This measures the separation between positive and negative distributions. Higher values indicate better model discrimination.
	2.	AUC (Area Under the Curve): Measures how well the model distinguishes between classes. A higher AUC indicates better performance.

Each segment and score category is benchmarked against:

	•	G12 score: Refers to a business model that uses Business DDA information.
	•	FICO09: A traditional credit score benchmark.

Key Findings:

	•	LightGBM outperforms G12 and FICO09 on all populations except for WF KGB in the No_Low_DDA segment, where G12 outperforms LightGBM.
	•	Reason for G12 outperforming: The G12 model uses Business DDA information that the new model (LightGBM) does not leverage.
	•	Business Request: The business wants the No_Low_DDA model to solely use consumer data from the bureau to prescreen prospects.

Performance Breakdown:

Established_DDA:

	•	TTD:
	•	ML lift (Machine Learning lift) over benchmark is consistently positive (2%–6%) in both KS and AUC across train, test, and out-of-time datasets.
	•	KGB:
	•	ML lift over benchmark is also positive, with notable lifts (5%–7%) in KS and 2%–4% in AUC.
	•	WF KGB:
	•	ML lift is strong, particularly in KS metrics, showing 7%–9% improvements over benchmarks.

No_Low_DDA:

	•	TTD:
	•	Minimal or negative ML lift in KS, except a slight improvement in test and out-of-time AUC (1%–2%).
	•	KGB:
	•	ML lift is marginal, with some positive gains in KS and slight improvements in AUC.
	•	WF KGB:
	•	Negative ML lift in both KS and AUC, showing that G12’s use of Business DDA data significantly boosts its performance over the new model.

Highlighted Insights:

	•	The No_Low_DDA model is constrained by its exclusion of Business DDA information, as required by the business, which impacts its performance compared to G12.

The image you’ve shared shows the MRM’s Independent Benchmarking results comparing different segments and populations based on performance metrics, such as KS and AUC, for the models XGBoost and GAMI-Tree against the CoE’s LOB (Line of Business) model.

Key Components:

Models:

	•	MRM(XGBoost): Machine Learning model based on XGBoost used by MRM (Model Risk Management).
	•	MRM(GAMI-Tree): Another model based on the Generalized Additive Model with Interactions (GAMI).
	•	LOB: Line of Business model, likely a reference model being used for benchmarking.

Metrics:

	1.	KS: Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, used for evaluating how well a model separates two distributions.
	2.	AUC: Area Under the Curve, used for assessing the classification ability of a model.
	3.	Lift (f|KS or f|AUC): Shows how much lift is provided by the XGBoost or GAMI-Tree models over the LOB model based on KS or AUC.

Segments and Populations:

The benchmarking is divided into three key segments:

	1.	Total Population: Includes the combined population of various models (AGB, KGB, WFKGB).
	2.	Established_DDA: Accounts with an established history in the DDA.
	3.	No_Low_DDA: Accounts with no or low DDA activity.

For each segment, results are provided for different time horizons, such as 70 days (70D), 30 days (30V), and out-of-time (OOT) datasets.

Observations:

	1.	XGBoost Model:
	•	The KS and AUC values are consistent across different segments and populations, with slight improvements seen in AGB, KGB, and WFKGB across both Established_DDA and No_Low_DDA populations.
	•	The lift values (f|KS and f|AUC) across the board are minimal but generally positive, indicating marginal improvements over the LOB model.
	2.	GAMI-Tree Model:
	•	Similar trends are observed with GAMI-Tree, where the lift values, while small, show that its performance is comparable to the CoE’s LOB model.

Key Takeaway:

MRM has concluded that both XGBoost and GAMI-Tree models perform on par with the CoE’s LOB model. The small, positive lift values indicate that the models provide slight improvements over the LOB model but are generally close in performance.

This benchmarking highlights that MRM’s machine learning models are validated as effective alternatives to the CoE model.

The image outlines the process and results of Uncertainty Quantification for a LightGBM model in the “Established_DDA” segment. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and findings:

Purpose:

The goal is to assess whether the model developer has accounted for all important sources of variation in the data and model, and to quantify their magnitudes.

Steps Involved:

	1.	Create 20 bootstrapped training datasets to capture variation.
	2.	Train a LightGBM model on each of these 20 bootstrapped samples.
	3.	Score the entire population using each model.
	4.	For each observation, calculate the score range (max - min) across the 20 models.
	5.	Visualize uncertainty in the model predictions.

Visualizations and Results:

	1.	Distribution of the Average Predicted Score by Model:
	•	This plot shows the average predicted score across all bootstrapped models for the Established_DDA segment. The scores fluctuate slightly but remain relatively stable, indicating consistency in the model’s predictive output.
	2.	Distribution of the Standard Deviation of the Predicted Scores by Model:
	•	This graph visualizes the standard deviation (std) of the predicted scores across the models. The std also remains fairly stable across the models, implying that the variability in predictions is well controlled.
	3.	Score Range Variations Among the Train Data (except the top 200 scores):
	•	This plot shows the distribution of the score range (max - min) across the train data, excluding the top 200 scores. The bulk of the observations have small score ranges, indicating that most predictions are consistent across models.
	4.	Top 200 Score Ranges Among the Train Data:
	•	This histogram highlights the score ranges for the top 200 observations in the training data. There are some larger score ranges here, indicating higher uncertainty in predictions for these top observations, but the majority of the range values are still controlled.

Key Insights:

	•	Considering PDO (Points to Double Odds) is 40:
	•	The mean and standard deviation of the scores are stable across the different bootstrapped models.
	•	The score range (max - min) is small, with less than 0.03% of observations having a range greater than 40, which indicates that the model’s predictions are fairly robust and not overly sensitive to variations in the data.

This analysis demonstrates that the LightGBM model has well-quantified uncertainty and shows consistency in its predictions across different bootstrapped datasets.

The image outlines a process for Weakness Detection through Residual Analysis to evaluate a model’s global and local performance, providing insights on potential improvements and identifying areas where the model underperforms.

Purpose:

	1.	Global Analysis: Check if there are leftover signals in the residuals that could further improve the model’s performance.
	2.	Local Analysis: Identify specific regions or areas where the model performs poorly.

Approach:

Two residual models are used:

	1.	Global Offset Residual Model:
	•	The CoE’s model is treated as the target (baseline) model.
	•	This model uses the base margin from the CoE’s model to continue boosting with an XGBoost offset model.
	2.	Local Linear Model Based Tree (MBT):
	•	Fit a Linear Model-Based Tree (MBT) to the residuals of the global offset residual model to detect any local patterns.

Key Results:

	•	Global and Local Performance:
	•	Both global and local models show very close performance in terms of AUC and KS statistics across different time horizons (70D, 30V, OOT).
	•	The residual analysis reveals no significant leftover signals, meaning that no substantial performance improvements can be made based on residuals.

Key Metrics:

	•	AUC (Area Under Curve) and KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic) scores are shown for the global and local models.
	•	The metrics are fairly consistent across Established_DDA for 70D, 30V, and OOT datasets:
	•	AUC ranges from 0.763 to 0.777.
	•	KS ranges from 0.398 to 0.404.

Visualization Highlights:

	1.	CICE Plot:
	•	The CICE plot (Cumulative Importance Curves Error) indicates that the overall performance error is minimal, and no major residual signals are detected.
	2.	Permutation Variable Importance:
	•	The permutation importance chart shows which variables contribute the most to the residuals in the global offset model. This helps in understanding what influences any leftover signals in the residuals (though in this case, no significant signals are left).
	3.	Residual Model Heatmap:
	•	The heatmap provides a visual summary of the correlation between different features in the residual model, highlighting potential relationships or interactions.

Conclusion:

	•	No signals are left in the residuals. This indicates that the model has accounted for all important sources of variation in the data, and there’s no significant room for further improvement through residual analysis.

This approach effectively confirms that the model performs well globally and locally, without major weaknesses in specific regions of the data.

The image you provided details Model Explainability using different methods to understand the impact of features on model predictions. Here’s a breakdown of the elements and findings:

Key Methods for Model Explainability:

	1.	Centralized P(1) Plot: Measures the total effect of a feature on model prediction.
	2.	Accumulated Local Effects (ALE): Measures the total effect of a feature on model prediction while holding other features constant, offering a localized perspective of how each feature impacts predictions.
	3.	FANOVA Decomposition: A tool that captures both the main effect and interaction effect of a predictor. This decomposition helps purify the contribution of each feature.

Table Overview:

The table presents features with their associated statistics, explanations, and descriptions:

	•	Count: Number of instances for each range of a feature (e.g., bcc5620: [0, 280]).
	•	P(1): Indicates the overall influence of the feature.
	•	Center P(1): Represents the adjusted effect after centralization.
	•	Explanation: The interpretation of each feature, providing insight into why the feature is important.
	•	Variable Description: Describes the variable and its role in the prediction.

Feature Highlight: bcc5620

	•	The P(1) value for bcc5620 suggests it has a 66.5% contribution to the model’s decisions.
	•	Explanation: This feature measures the total available credit amount on open revolving bankcard trades in the last 6 months. Applicants with lower available credit are more likely to face difficulties in making payments.

Visualizations:

	1.	Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plot (Top-left graph):
	•	The ALE plot for bcc5620 shows how changes in this feature influence predictions. The plot has a rising curve, indicating that as the value of bcc5620 (credit amount) increases, the model predicts a lower likelihood of payment difficulties, likely suggesting better credit health.
	2.	FANOVA (Main Effect) Plot (Top-right graph):
	•	The main effect for bcc5620 is visualized. The step function shows the interaction across different ranges of the feature. The plot illustrates that the feature has a 10.9% contribution to the total variance in model output.
	3.	FANOVA (Interaction Effect) Heatmap (Bottom-right graph):
	•	This heatmap visualizes the interaction between bcc5620 and another feature, reh7120. The interactions are color-coded to show positive and negative effects. The contribution of this interaction is 2.3% to the total model variability.

Key Takeaway:

	•	The variable bcc5620 (available credit amount on open revolving bankcard trades) is crucial for predicting payment difficulties. The ALE plot shows the positive relationship between credit availability and better outcomes (fewer difficulties). The FANOVA decomposition highlights that this feature has significant main and interaction effects.

The image discusses Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC) and the use of Shapley values to explain why certain applicants are rejected, following the regulations stipulated by ECOA (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) Regulation B. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the components:

Key Requirements from ECOA Regulation B:

	•	Creditors must disclose the principal reasons for denying an application or taking other adverse action against a credit applicant.

Approach:

	1.	The Top 1% scoring population serves as the reference profile. This profile is used to calculate the score difference between a rejected applicant and the top-scoring applicant.
	2.	Baseline Shapley value is applied to attribute the score difference to each feature, allowing for clear identification of adverse action reasons (AAR).
	3.	Calculations are simplified when the scoring function is expressed as the sum of main effects and interaction terms.
	4.	MRM (Model Risk Management) independently replicated the AARC process.

Example of Baseline Shapley Calculation:

The table provides an example of how Shapley values are used to determine the contribution of various features to the rejection decision.

	•	Variables:
	•	REH7120 (x₁) and ALL2320 (x₂) are two features.
	•	There’s also an interaction term between these features (x₁, x₂).
	•	Rejected Applicant’s Score: For the rejected applicant:
	•	REH7120 has a score of 5.
	•	ALL2320 has a score of 20.
	•	The interaction term contributes a score of 1.
	•	Reference (Baseline, Max) Score: For the reference profile (top 1% scorers), the corresponding scores for these features are 30, 40, and 9 respectively.
	•	Distance from Reference: The difference between the rejected applicant’s score and the reference score:
	•	REH7120 has a difference of 25.
	•	ALL2320 has a difference of 20.
	•	The interaction term difference is 8.
	•	Total Shapley Value: This is the sum of the difference and an additional component, which helps attribute the contribution of each feature. For example:
	•	REH7120: Total Shapley value is 31 (25 + 6).
	•	ALL2320: Total Shapley value is 22 (20 + 2).
	•	Interaction: Total Shapley value is 8.
	•	Adverse Action Reason: Based on the total Shapley values, the primary reasons for rejection are ranked:
	•	REH7120 is the 1st reason.
	•	ALL2320 is the 2nd reason.

Conclusion:

This process uses Shapley values to assign responsibility for the difference in scores between a rejected applicant and the reference population, helping to determine the Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC) in compliance with ECOA Regulation B.

Let me know if you’d like more insights or further explanations on how Shapley values are used in model explainability for adverse action decisions!

The image outlines the AARC (Adverse Action Reason Codes) Reference Points Calculation, focusing on how the reference is determined based on the concentration of the top 1% scoring population in a development sample.

Key Steps in the Calculation:

	1.	Binning the Variables:
	•	The variables are first binned using Weight of Evidence (WOE) binning. This step groups similar values for a variable to simplify the analysis.
	2.	Concentration of the Top 1% Population:
	•	For each bin, the concentration of the top 1% scoring population is calculated. The bin with the highest concentration of top 1% scorers will be chosen as the reference bin, representing the best credit profile.
	•	This reference bin helps in establishing a baseline for calculating the Baseline Shapley value, which will be used to attribute the score difference to each feature when explaining adverse action reasons.

Example Table - Calculation of Reference by Concentration:

The table provides an example of the binned values for a variable (bcc7110), showing:

	•	Bin ranges (e.g., r00: [-inf, 1.0], r01: [1.0, 7.5], etc.).
	•	Count: The total number of samples in each bin.
	•	Count (Top 1%): The number of top 1% scoring individuals in each bin.
	•	Concentration: The ratio of top 1% scoring individuals to the total number of individuals in the bin, indicating how concentrated the top 1% scorers are in each bin.

Key Highlight:

	•	The bin r01: [1.0, 7.5] has the highest concentration of the top 1% population (0.050247842), and thus it is chosen as the reference bin.
	•	Other bins have lower concentrations of the top 1% population, ranging from 0.003349534 (for bin r00) to nearly zero for others.

Purpose of This Calculation:

The reference bin represents the best credit profile (in this case, based on variable bcc7110). When evaluating rejected applicants, their scores will be compared against this reference bin to understand why they were rejected, and the Shapley value will help quantify the contribution of each feature to this decision.

Understanding Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC)

Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC) are a set of explanations that lenders and financial institutions provide to applicants when they deny credit or take adverse actions such as rejecting a loan application or increasing interest rates. These codes help ensure compliance with regulations like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) Regulation B, which requires creditors to disclose the principal reasons for denying an application.

The Purpose of AARC:

	1.	Transparency: The goal is to provide applicants with clear, data-driven reasons for rejection or adverse action.
	2.	Fair Lending: Ensures that decisions are based on objective factors rather than biases or discriminatory practices.
	3.	Compliance with ECOA: By providing adverse action reasons, creditors comply with federal regulations, offering applicants insights into the decisions affecting their credit applications.

How AARC Is Calculated:

To generate accurate AARC, the process typically involves analyzing model predictions and breaking down the contributing factors. One widely used method is the Shapley value method from cooperative game theory, which attributes a proportion of the decision to each contributing feature (or variable) in the model.

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the AARC calculation process as shown in the image:

1. Top 1% Population as a Reference:

	•	The top 1% of the scoring population, often representing applicants with the best credit profiles, is used as a reference for comparison. This segment is expected to have the most favorable characteristics in terms of creditworthiness.
	•	The rejected applicant’s score is compared to the scores of this top 1% reference group. By identifying the difference between the rejected applicant’s profile and that of the top scorers, the model can pinpoint which factors led to the rejection.

2. Binning Using Weight of Evidence (WOE):

	•	Variables are binned, typically using WOE binning. WOE is a statistical technique used to group continuous or categorical variables into discrete categories that are predictive of the outcome, such as loan approval or rejection.
	•	Each bin represents a range of values for a particular feature, and the concentration of top scorers is calculated within each bin.

3. Selecting the Reference Bin:

	•	For each variable, the bin with the highest concentration of top 1% scores is chosen as the reference bin. This bin represents the most favorable credit profile for that variable.
	•	For example, in the table provided, the bin r01: [1.0, 7.5] for variable bcc7110 is selected as the reference bin because it has the highest concentration of top 1% scores (0.050247842).

4. Shapley Value Calculation:

	•	Shapley values are calculated based on the difference between the rejected applicant’s feature values and the values in the reference bin.
	•	The Shapley value represents the contribution of each feature to the rejection decision, breaking down the impact of each variable on the final score.
	•	The sum of all Shapley values across features gives the total contribution for each variable.

5. Adverse Action Reason Codes:

	•	After calculating the Shapley values, the variables that contribute most significantly to the score difference are ranked as adverse action reasons.
	•	The top variables with the highest Shapley values are the key reasons for the adverse action (e.g., loan rejection or adverse credit terms).
	•	For example, in a rejected credit application, Feature 1 (such as low credit available) might be the most important factor, while Feature 2 (such as a history of missed payments) could be the second most important factor in the decision.

AARC Example:

Here’s how it works in practice:

	1.	For a rejected applicant, the score of a feature (e.g., amount of available credit) is compared to the reference score (the score for that feature in the top 1% group).
	2.	The difference between these scores is measured. For example, if the rejected applicant has a score of 20 for available credit and the reference score is 40, the difference is 20.
	3.	This difference is used to calculate the Shapley value, which reflects how much the available credit feature contributed to the rejection. The sum of all differences across features helps explain why the applicant was rejected.
	4.	Based on the Shapley values, the Adverse Action Reason Codes are determined. If available credit is the largest contributor to the difference in scores, it will be listed as the primary reason for rejection.

Summary:

	•	AARC is a crucial tool for providing transparency to applicants, ensuring fair lending, and maintaining regulatory compliance.
	•	By comparing rejected applicants’ profiles with those of the top 1% scoring population, creditors can identify the specific reasons for rejection.
	•	Shapley values are instrumental in attributing the rejection decision to the relevant features, helping to explain the adverse action in a clear and understandable way.

Let me know if you need further details or clarification!

The image provides details about AARC Suppression, specifically focusing on how the adverse action reason codes (AARC) logic suppresses certain special codes (e.g., “bus7130”) from being included in the top 4 adverse action codes for rejected applications. Below is a breakdown of the key points:

Key Components of AARC Suppression:

	1.	AARC Suppression Logic:
	•	The AARC logic is designed to suppress special code 998 related to bus7130 from appearing in the top 4 adverse action reason codes. This ensures that certain situations where data is either not relevant or available do not result in an incorrect adverse action explanation.
	2.	Bus7130:
	•	Bus7130 refers to the balance-to-credit amount ratio on an open revolving bankcard trade with the highest balance and a credit amount greater than $0, reported in the last 6 months.
	•	This metric is used to assess an applicant’s creditworthiness, particularly how well they manage their available credit.
	3.	Special Code 998:
	•	Special code 998 indicates no revolving bankcard trade on file. This can arise in cases where the applicant does not have an open revolving credit line or a business card, which may affect the scoring model’s evaluation of their credit.
	4.	CoE’s Email Response:
	•	The CoE (Center of Excellence) raised a concern that several issuers do not report business cards to the consumer credit bureau. This means that in cases where there is no business card data available, the adverse action verbiage stating the absence of business cards might not be accurate.
	•	CoE’s email further noted: “The special value indicated there is no business card. The adverse action verbiage indicating absence of business cards may not be accurate.” This issue was discussed and approved by legal, compliance, and the FRL (Fair Lending) team during the verbiage review.
	5.	MRF Recommendation:
	•	MRM (Model Risk Management) recommends that the CoE document the suppression of special codes in the Model Development Documentation (MDD) and attach any relevant approvals from legal and compliance teams.
	•	This is necessary to ensure that any modifications to AARC suppression logic are traceable and align with regulatory and legal standards.

Summary:

	•	AARC suppression is applied to ensure that irrelevant or inaccurate codes, such as “bus7130” (balance-to-credit ratio) and code 998 (no revolving bankcard trade), are not included in the top adverse action reasons.
	•	CoE has raised concerns about the accuracy of adverse action reasons, especially when business card data is not available, and these concerns were addressed by legal and compliance teams.
	•	MRM advises that the CoE document these suppression decisions and approvals to maintain transparency and compliance.

The image focuses on Stress Testing for assessing how economic downturns affect model outputs, with a particular emphasis on shifts in feature distributions under different economic scenarios.

Key Objective:

The goal of stress testing is to evaluate the impact of an economic downturn on the model’s output. The test simulates different scenarios that might cause an input shift (i.e., a change in the distribution of key input variables), which in turn causes changes in the model’s predictions.

Two Economic Scenarios:

	1.	Mild Adverse: A moderate economic downturn scenario.
	2.	Severely Adverse: A more extreme downturn scenario.

How the Stress Test Is Conducted:

	1.	Feature Shifts: The top 10 features (those most influential in the model’s prediction) are shifted in the direction of increased risk.
	•	CoE’s approach: Shift the top features by ±0.25 (mild) or ±0.5 (severely) standard deviations (std dev).
	•	MRM’s approach: Shift the features by 1 (mild) or 2 (severely) bins.
	2.	Model Calculation: The model scores are recalculated based on the shifted attributes, simulating how the predictions would change under each scenario.
	3.	Overlay Score Distributions: The score distributions from the stress-tested scenarios are plotted on top of the original distribution, showing how the predictions shift in response to the economic downturn.

Results (Visualization):

	1.	TTD Distribution—Established_DDA:
	•	The distribution shows how the model’s log odds scores shift for the Established_DDA segment under mild (green) and severe (orange) adverse conditions, compared to the original (blue) distribution.
	•	The shift indicates that, as expected, more of the population shifts towards riskier outcomes as the adverse scenario worsens.
	2.	TTD Distribution—No_Low_DDA:
	•	A similar plot is provided for the No_Low_DDA segment. Here too, the shift towards riskier outcomes is observed, with a broader range of log odds scores under severe adverse conditions.

Conclusion:

	•	Model scores shift in the expected direction under both mild and severely adverse scenarios, reflecting the expected increase in risk associated with economic downturns.

MRF’s Observation:

	•	The CoE did not explain why a bimodal shape is observed in some of the stress-tested score distributions. This shape suggests that there may be two distinct groups or behaviors in the population under stress, which would need further investigation to understand fully.

Summary:

The stress testing results align with expectations: as economic conditions worsen, the model shifts its predictions toward higher risk outcomes. However, the presence of a bimodal distribution in some segments (likely due to distinct risk subgroups) remains unexplained, and would benefit from additional analysis.

Let me know if you’d like further explanations on any part of this process!

Here is a comprehensive summary of all the outputs provided during this session:

1. Model Robustness and Comparison:

The key information discusses how robustness is defined as the model’s ability to maintain stable performance in the presence of noise or small changes in covariates. Key metrics used to assess robustness include ArPPV, Perturbed AUC, and Spearman Rank Correlation. Four models are compared: LightGBM, ScoreCard, XGB_dep2 (maximum AUC from unconstrained XGBoost), and XGB_dep6 (overfitted XGBoost). The performance of these models across training, testing, and out-of-time datasets is summarized in a table, indicating overfitting in the XGB_dep6 model and consistent generalization performance for LightGBM and XGB_dep2.

2. Performance Benchmark from CoE:

A detailed benchmark shows performance for various models across different segments (Established_DDA and No_Low_DDA), considering metrics like KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and AUC (Area Under Curve). The CoE found that LightGBM outperformed G12 and FICO09 in most cases except for WF KGB in the No_Low_DDA segment, where G12 performed better because it used Business DDA data that the new model did not. The conclusion was that the business wanted the No_Low_DDA model to focus solely on consumer bureau data to prescreen prospects.

3. MRM’s Independent Benchmarking:

MRM independently benchmarked its models using XGBoost and GAMI-Tree against the CoE’s LOB model. Both models performed comparably to CoE’s model, as indicated by small, positive lift values in terms of KS and AUC metrics across various segments. MRM concluded that its models perform on par with the CoE’s model.

4. Uncertainty Quantification:

The purpose of uncertainty quantification was to assess whether all significant sources of variation in the data and model were identified. The method involved creating 20 bootstrapped datasets and training LightGBM models on them. The distribution of average and standard deviation of predicted scores was visualized, showing stable performance across models. The conclusion was that the score ranges (max - min) were minimal, with less than 0.03% of observations having a range above 40.

5. Weakness Detection through Residual Analysis:

This process involved using residual models to check if there were signals left in the residuals that could improve model performance or identify poorly performing regions. The two models used were the global offset residual model (using CoE’s model) and a local linear model-based tree (MBT). The analysis showed no significant signals left in the residuals, meaning the model had already accounted for most important variations.

6. Model Explainability Using Shapley Values and FANOVA:

Several techniques were used to explain the model’s decisions:

	•	Centralized P(1) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE): These methods helped assess the total effect of features on model predictions. FANOVA decomposition was used to isolate the main and interaction effects of the predictors.
	•	FANOVA: Explained variables’ contributions to predictions by decomposing the contributions into main and interaction effects, using Sobo’s method (chosen by CoE) and Hooker’s method as alternatives. The validators confirmed that FANOVA met the required conditions.
	•	Shapley Values for Adverse Action Reasons: These were used to calculate which features contributed the most to an applicant’s rejection. The highest contributing features (based on the difference between the rejected applicant’s score and the reference top 1% population) determined the reasons for adverse action.

7. AARC (Adverse Action Reason Codes):



The ECOA Regulation B requires creditors to provide reasons for denying credit applications. The top 1% scoring population is used as a reference to calculate the score differences for rejected applicants. Shapley values are applied to distribute the score differences across features. An example showed how features like revolving credit balances impacted rejection decisions. This process helps provide clarity and fairness in credit decisions.

8. AARC Reference Points Calculation:

The reference points for AARC are calculated based on the concentration of top 1% scorers in different bins using WOE binning. The reference bin, representing the best credit profile, is selected based on the highest concentration of top scorers. The Shapley value is calculated relative to this reference value to explain adverse actions.

9. AARC Suppression:

The AARC logic is designed to suppress certain special codes (like ‘bus7130’ and code 998) from appearing in the top adverse action reason codes. Code ‘bus7130’ relates to the balance-to-credit amount ratio on an open revolving bankcard trade, while code 998 indicates no revolving bankcard trade. The CoE raised a concern about the inaccuracy of adverse action verbiage for business cards, as some issuers do not report business cards to the credit bureau. MRM recommended that the CoE document these suppressions in the Model Development Documentation (MDD).

10. Stress Testing:

Stress testing was conducted to simulate the effect of an economic downturn on the model’s output. Two scenarios were considered: mild adverse and severely adverse. Key features were shifted in the direction of increased risk, and the model’s scores were recalculated. The distribution of scores under stress conditions was compared to the original distribution. The results showed the expected shift towards higher risk under economic stress, but a bimodal shape was observed, which CoE did not explain.

This consolidated output provides an overview of each aspect discussed in this session. Let me know if you need more detailed insights or specific sections!











Let’s dive deeper into the Performance Benchmark from CoE to further analyze the findings.

Key Observations from the Benchmark:

	1.	Segments Evaluated:
	•	The benchmark evaluates performance across two main segments:
	•	Established_DDA: Refers to accounts with an established history in Direct Deposit Accounts (DDA).
	•	No_Low_DDA: Accounts with no or low DDA activity.
Each segment includes three models: TTD, KGB, and WF KGB. These models are compared against benchmarks like G12 score and FICO09, using metrics such as KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic) and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
	2.	Key Metrics:
	•	KS measures the separation between positive and negative distributions, indicating how well the model distinguishes between different outcomes. Higher values suggest better discriminatory power.
	•	AUC indicates how well the model can differentiate between positive and negative classes. Higher AUC values signify better overall performance.

Detailed Findings:

Established_DDA Segment:

	•	TTD:
	•	In terms of KS, the ML (Machine Learning) model consistently outperforms the benchmark, with improvements of 5% on train data, 4% on test data, and 6% on out-of-time (OOT) data.
	•	For AUC, the ML model shows marginal improvements (1%-3%) compared to the benchmark across train, test, and OOT datasets. This suggests that the ML model is slightly better at distinguishing between classes in established DDA accounts.
	•	KGB:
	•	Similar trends are observed, with KS improvements of 5%-7% in ML performance compared to the benchmark.
	•	AUC improvements range from 1% to 4%, showing that the ML model adds value by offering slightly better classification abilities than the benchmark.
	•	WF KGB:
	•	The ML model shows the most significant improvements in KS, with a 7%-9% lift over the benchmark, indicating a considerable enhancement in distinguishing between outcomes in this segment.
	•	AUC improvements range from 2%-4%, showing consistent model superiority.

No_Low_DDA Segment:

	•	TTD:
	•	The ML model exhibits minimal improvements over the benchmark in this segment. KS shows no improvement on the train set and only marginal improvements in test and OOT sets.
	•	AUC improvements are also modest, with only a 1%-2% increase over the benchmark. This suggests that for No_Low_DDA accounts, the model struggles to provide significant added value compared to the benchmark.
	•	KGB:
	•	The ML model’s performance is mixed, with no improvements in KS on the training set and negative KS lifts in the test and OOT datasets. This indicates that the ML model is not generalizing as well as expected in the No_Low_DDA segment.
	•	AUC improvements are also minimal, suggesting limited benefits from using the ML model in this particular segment.
	•	WF KGB:
	•	Similar to the KGB model, WF KGB shows negative lifts in both KS and AUC metrics, indicating that the ML model is underperforming compared to the benchmark. This reinforces the challenge of improving model performance for the No_Low_DDA population, where the dataset may be sparse or noisy, making it harder for the model to distinguish outcomes effectively.

Key Takeaways:

	1.	ML Model’s Strength in Established_DDA:
	•	The ML models generally perform well in the Established_DDA segment, showing strong lifts in both KS and AUC metrics. This indicates that when there is an established history of account activity (like consistent direct deposits), the model is better at predicting outcomes compared to the benchmark models.
	•	The ML models appear to extract meaningful patterns from the data in this segment, allowing them to outperform benchmarks like G12 and FICO09.
	2.	Challenges in No_Low_DDA:
	•	The No_Low_DDA segment proves more challenging for the ML models. With minimal or no DDA activity, it becomes difficult for the model to extract useful features that would differentiate between classes.
	•	The results show either minimal or negative lifts in KS and AUC for this segment, especially in WF KGB. This suggests that either the dataset is too limited in predictive features or the model needs further refinement to handle sparse or low-activity accounts.
	3.	Business Focus on Bureau Data:
	•	A crucial finding from the benchmark is that the business wants the No_Low_DDA model to solely focus on consumer bureau data to prescreen prospects, which further constrains the model’s ability to leverage additional features like Business DDA data.
	•	In contrast, the G12 model outperforms in the No_Low_DDA segment because it uses Business DDA data, which the new ML model does not leverage. This puts the ML model at a disadvantage, as it is forced to work with a more limited feature set.

Conclusion:

The ML models built by the CoE perform well in the Established_DDA segment, consistently outperforming benchmarks like G12 and FICO09 in both KS and AUC metrics. However, the performance is notably weaker in the No_Low_DDA segment, where the lack of direct deposit activity and limited feature set make it difficult for the model to distinguish between outcomes effectively. The business’s decision to restrict the model to consumer bureau data adds another layer of complexity, limiting the model’s ability to improve predictions in this challenging segment. Further work might be needed to improve performance in the No_Low_DDA population, perhaps through feature engineering or the inclusion of additional data sources.

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a critical process used in model validation to assess how sensitive a model’s predictions are to variations in data or changes in the model itself. In the context of machine learning, uncertainty quantification helps in understanding the robustness and reliability of a model by quantifying how much uncertainty is associated with its predictions.

Here is a more detailed explanation based on the image related to Uncertainty Quantification from the session:

Objective of Uncertainty Quantification:

The goal of uncertainty quantification is to assess whether all important sources of variation in the data and model have been identified and quantified. This ensures that the model’s performance is stable and reliable under varying conditions or inputs.

Steps in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ):

	1.	Bootstrapping the Data:
	•	Bootstrap samples are generated by repeatedly resampling from the original training data with replacement. In the case discussed in the session, 20 bootstrapped training datasets were created. Each dataset is slightly different from the others, allowing the model’s sensitivity to be evaluated across different training scenarios.
	•	Bootstrapping is useful because it allows you to simulate how the model would perform on different samples of data, thereby giving insight into the variability of the model’s predictions.
	2.	Training Models on Bootstrapped Data:
	•	A LightGBM model is trained on each of the 20 bootstrapped datasets. Since each dataset is slightly different due to the resampling process, this step helps in understanding how variations in the training data affect the model’s predictions.
	•	By training on these different datasets, we can evaluate how consistent the model’s performance is across different versions of the data.
	3.	Scoring the Population:
	•	Each of the 20 models (trained on the bootstrapped datasets) is used to score the entire population. This gives 20 different sets of predictions for the same set of data.
	•	By looking at the variation in predictions across these 20 models, we can assess how much uncertainty there is in the model’s predictions.
	4.	Calculating the Score Range:
	•	For each observation in the dataset, the score range (difference between the maximum and minimum predicted scores) is calculated. This range provides a direct measure of uncertainty: a large range indicates that the model’s predictions are highly variable, while a small range suggests stable and consistent predictions.
	5.	Visualizing Uncertainty in Predictions:
	•	The final step is to visualize the uncertainty in the model’s predictions across the 20 bootstrapped models. The image provided shows various visualizations to highlight the uncertainty in model predictions.

Visualizations and Findings:

	1.	Distribution of the Average Predicted Score by Model:
	•	This plot shows the average predicted score for each model across the 20 bootstrapped datasets. If the model is robust, the average predicted scores should be consistent across different models.
	•	The image shows that the average predicted scores remain relatively stable across the 20 models, indicating that the model is robust to small variations in the training data.
	2.	Distribution of the Standard Deviation of Predicted Scores:
	•	This plot shows the standard deviation (std dev) of the predicted scores for each model. The standard deviation gives a measure of the spread of the predictions: lower std dev means that predictions are tightly clustered, while higher std dev means predictions are more spread out.
	•	The std dev values are also relatively stable across the 20 models, which suggests that the uncertainty in the model’s predictions is controlled and not highly variable.
	3.	Score Range Variations Among the Train Data (Excluding Top 200 Scores):
	•	This plot shows the distribution of score ranges for the majority of the data (excluding the top 200 scores). The score range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum predicted score for each observation across the 20 models.
	•	The majority of the observations have relatively small score ranges, indicating that the model’s predictions are consistent and not highly sensitive to changes in the training data.
	4.	Top 200 Score Ranges Among the Train Data:
	•	This plot shows the score ranges specifically for the top 200 observations in the dataset. These observations might represent edge cases or more difficult predictions, which is why they have larger score ranges than the general population.
	•	While most score ranges are small, a few larger ranges are observed in the top 200 scores, indicating higher uncertainty for these specific predictions.

Key Findings:

	•	Score Stability: The mean and standard deviation of the predicted scores are stable across the different models trained on bootstrapped datasets. This indicates that the model’s predictions are robust and not overly sensitive to small variations in the data.
	•	Minimal Score Range: The score range (max - min) is small for the vast majority of observations. Less than 0.03% of observations have a score range above 40, which means the model is consistently producing similar predictions for most of the population. This further confirms the robustness of the model.
	•	Edge Cases: While the model performs consistently for most of the population, the top 200 score ranges show slightly higher uncertainty. These are likely edge cases where the model struggles more to make confident predictions, leading to a wider range of predicted scores.

Conclusion:

The uncertainty quantification process demonstrates that the model is stable and performs consistently across different bootstrapped datasets. The mean and standard deviation of the predicted scores are stable, and score ranges are small for the majority of the population. However, there is slightly more uncertainty for the top 200 observations, indicating that the model may require further refinement for handling difficult cases. Overall, the results suggest that the model is robust and reliable under small changes in the training data.

Weakness Detection Through Residual Analysis

Weakness detection through residual analysis is a technique used to determine whether there are remaining patterns or signals in the residuals of a model that could indicate poor model performance or areas where the model can be improved. By analyzing the residuals, you can identify potential weaknesses in the model and improve its accuracy or generalization.

Here’s an in-depth explanation of the process, based on the image provided:

Objective of Weakness Detection:

The purpose is twofold:

	1.	Global Analysis: Check if there are any remaining signals in the residuals that might indicate that the model has not fully captured the patterns in the data. If there are leftover signals, they might be used to improve the model’s performance further.
	2.	Local Analysis: Identify specific regions or subgroups in the data where the model is underperforming. This can help isolate areas where the model’s predictions are consistently poor, allowing for targeted improvements.

Approach to Residual Analysis:

Residual analysis is typically done using residual models—models that are trained on the residuals of the original model. The residuals are simply the differences between the actual outcomes and the predicted outcomes from the model. If the original model was perfect, the residuals would be pure noise. However, if the residuals show structure, there might be weaknesses in the model that could be addressed.

Two Residual Models:

	1.	Global Offset Residual Model:
	•	In this approach, the residuals from the CoE’s (Center of Excellence) target model are used as the base margin. The residuals from this base margin are then boosted with an XGBoost model to see if any further improvements can be made.
	•	This model helps detect global issues, such as if the entire population is being under-predicted or if certain features are not being fully captured.
	2.	Local Linear Model-Based Tree (MBT):
	•	This is a local model that fits a linear model-based tree (MBT) to the residuals of the global offset model. The goal of this model is to capture local patterns in the data that might not have been captured by the global model.
	•	It helps identify specific regions or subsets of data where the original model may be underperforming, potentially due to interactions between variables that were not modeled correctly.

Key Metrics in Residual Analysis:

The performance of the residual models is evaluated using standard metrics like:

	•	AUC (Area Under the Curve): Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes. A higher AUC suggests better model performance.
	•	KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic): Measures the separation between the positive and negative distributions, indicating how well the model is differentiating between the two outcomes.

Findings:

	1.	Global Offset and Local Residual Models:
	•	Both the global and local residual models performed similarly in terms of AUC and KS metrics across different datasets (e.g., 70D, 30V, OOT). There was little difference between the global and local models, suggesting that the model’s overall structure captured the necessary relationships well.
	•	The metrics remained consistent, with minimal differences between the global offset model and the local model. For example:
	•	The AUC and KS metrics are close to 0.763 and 0.403, respectively, for both models across different time frames, indicating that the residuals did not contain substantial leftover signals.
	2.	No Significant Signals Left in Residuals:
	•	The residual analysis showed that no significant signals were left in the residuals. This means that the original model has done a good job of capturing the important patterns in the data, and no major improvements could be made by further boosting the residuals.
	•	If there had been signals left in the residuals, it would indicate that the original model was missing something, and further boosting (like with the XGBoost model) could have improved the predictions.
	3.	CICE Plot:
	•	The CICE plot (Cumulative Importance Curves Error) was used to visualize whether there was any significant error left in the model. The flatness of the CICE plot suggests that the error in the model is minimal, meaning that the residuals are close to being pure noise.
	4.	Permutation Variable Importance:
	•	Permutation variable importance measures how much a feature contributes to the model’s residuals. In this case, the variable importance plot showed that no features stood out as having a major impact on the residuals, further indicating that the model has accounted for the significant relationships in the data.
	5.	Residual Model Heatmap:
	•	The heatmap of residuals provides a visual representation of the correlation between features in the residual model. In this case, the heatmap showed no strong correlations between features, suggesting that no major interactions were missed by the original model.

Conclusion:

The residual analysis confirms that the original model performs well both globally and locally, with no significant signals left in the residuals. This means that the model has captured the key relationships in the data and that further improvements to the model’s structure are unlikely to yield significant gains in performance.

However, MRF (Model Risk Function) noted that the CoE did not explain the bimodal shape observed in the residual distributions, which could indicate two distinct groups in the data or some unaccounted interaction. Further investigation into this bimodal shape might be warranted.

Importance of Residual Analysis for Model Weakness Detection:
l
	•	Residual analysis is a powerful tool for identifying model weaknesses. By checking the residuals for leftover patterns or signals, modelers can determine whether the model is missing important information.
	•	The global residual model helps in identifying broad issues, while the local residual model can identify more targeted weaknesses in specific subgroups.
	•	In this case, the residual analysis confirmed that the original model is robust, and no further improvements were necessary. However, identifying the reason for the bimodal shape in some of the residuals would enhance the interpretability and trust in the model.

Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC) - In-depth Explanation

Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC) are a critical tool for providing transparency in credit decisions, especially in cases where a lender denies an application or takes other adverse actions (e.g., raising interest rates or limiting credit). They are required under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) Regulation B, which mandates that creditors disclose the principal reasons for denying credit or taking any other adverse action.

Objective of AARC:

The primary goals of AARC are:

	1.	Transparency: Providing clear, objective reasons to the applicant for the denial or adverse action.
	2.	Fair Lending Practices: Ensuring that credit decisions are made based on objective, measurable criteria rather than biases or unfair practices.
	3.	Compliance with ECOA: By providing adverse action reasons, lenders comply with ECOA Regulation B, which promotes fairness and prevents discrimination in credit markets.

AARC Calculation Process:

The process of determining Adverse Action Reason Codes involves comparing the rejected applicant’s profile with a reference profile of high-scoring individuals. This comparison helps pinpoint the key factors that contributed to the adverse decision.

Here’s a breakdown of the steps:

1. Top 1% Population as a Reference:

	•	In most cases, the top 1% of the scoring population, representing individuals with the best credit profiles, is used as the reference group.
	•	The rejected applicant’s score is compared to this top 1% population to identify differences between their profiles and that of the best creditworthy applicants. The bigger the differences, the more likely they contributed to the adverse action.

2. Weight of Evidence (WOE) Binning:

	•	The key features or variables in the credit model (e.g., revolving credit balances, income, credit history) are binned using WOE binning. This is a statistical method that converts continuous or categorical variables into discrete bins based on how well they differentiate between good and bad credit outcomes.
	•	Binning helps simplify the analysis by grouping values of features into meaningful categories. For example, a feature like “revolving credit balance” might be divided into bins like [0–$1000], [$1000–$5000], and so on.

3. Selecting the Reference Bin:

	•	For each feature, the bin with the highest concentration of top 1% scorers is selected as the reference bin. This bin represents the most favorable value for that feature in the top scoring population.
	•	For instance, in the case of a feature like balance to credit amount ratio, the bin that contains individuals with a low ratio might be selected as the reference bin, as these individuals are less likely to be seen as credit risks.

4. Shapley Value Calculation:

	•	Shapley values are used to attribute the overall score difference between the rejected applicant and the reference population to each feature. The Shapley value is derived from cooperative game theory and represents how much each feature contributes to the outcome (in this case, the rejection).
	•	The Shapley value shows which features had the most significant impact on the rejection decision. Features with higher Shapley values contributed more to the score difference and are more likely to appear as adverse action reasons.

5. Adverse Action Reason Codes:

	•	After the Shapley values are calculated, the top contributing features are listed as Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC).
	•	For instance, if a low credit limit and high debt-to-income ratio contributed the most to the rejection, these would be listed as the primary reasons for the denial.
	•	The adverse action reason codes explain to the applicant which factors most significantly impacted their application outcome, providing clarity on what needs to be improved.

AARC Example: Shapley Calculation

Let’s consider an example of how Shapley values are used in the AARC calculation:

	•	Suppose the feature REH7120 represents the total revolving credit balance, and the feature ALL2320 represents the credit utilization ratio.
	•	For a rejected applicant, the score for REH7120 might be 5, while the top 1% reference score for this feature is 30. The difference is 25, indicating that the applicant has a significantly higher revolving balance than the top 1% population.
	•	The Shapley value for this feature would be calculated based on this difference, and if it turns out to be significant, REH7120 would be listed as the first adverse action reason.
	•	Similarly, the score for ALL2320 might show a difference of 20 between the rejected applicant and the reference population. This feature would also have a high Shapley value and might be listed as the second adverse action reason.

Handling Edge Cases and Special Codes:

In some cases, there might be special scenarios where features like revolving credit balances or business card usage don’t apply to the applicant. These cases are handled by suppressing specific codes (e.g., Bus7130 for business card balances or special code 998 for no revolving bankcard trade). The suppression logic ensures that these irrelevant features don’t end up being listed as adverse action reasons.

Example of Suppression:

	•	Bus7130: This refers to the balance-to-credit amount ratio on an open revolving bankcard trade. If an applicant does not have a revolving bankcard trade, a special suppression code (like 998) is applied to avoid listing this as an adverse action reason, which would be irrelevant and misleading.
	•	The CoE raised concerns in one example about issuers who do not report business card information to consumer credit bureaus. In this case, an applicant could be unfairly penalized for not having business card information, so the suppression logic ensures that no inaccurate reason codes are assigned.

Documentation and Compliance:

	•	To maintain compliance and ensure transparency, any suppression logic or special handling of adverse action reasons is documented in the Model Development Documentation (MDD). This documentation tracks all adjustments made to the AARC logic and ensures that the process remains auditable and in line with regulatory requirements.

Stress Testing AARC:

Another aspect to consider is stress testing the AARC logic. Stress testing involves simulating economic downturns or adverse financial conditions to see how the model’s output (and the resulting AARC) changes under such conditions. The goal is to ensure that the model remains robust and continues to provide meaningful adverse action reasons, even in challenging economic environments.

For instance, in a mild adverse or severely adverse scenario, certain features (such as debt-to-income ratio or credit balances) might shift due to economic factors like job loss or inflation. The stress testing process would involve shifting these features and recalculating the model output and AARC to ensure that the logic holds up under stress.

Conclusion:

The Adverse Action Reason Codes (AARC) process is a critical component of lending transparency and fairness. It involves comparing a rejected applicant’s profile to a reference population of top scorers, using Shapley values to determine which features contributed most to the adverse action, and providing clear, objective explanations for the decision.

AARC helps ensure that lending decisions are based on objective factors and that applicants have a clear understanding of why they were denied. This process is not only essential for regulatory compliance but also plays a key role in maintaining trust and fairness in credit markets.

The image provides an explanation of Model Explainability using FANOVA (Functional ANOVA Decomposition). Here’s a detailed breakdown of the information:

FANOVA (Functional ANOVA Decomposition):

The purpose of FANOVA is to decompose the contribution of different variables in a model into their main effects and interaction effects. This allows for enhanced interpretation of how individual variables and their interactions affect the model’s output.

Equation:

The general equation for FANOVA decomposition is:

\[
F(x) = f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + f_3(x_3) + f_{12}(x_1, x_2) + f_{13}(x_1, x_3) + f_{23}(x_2, x_3) + \dots
\]

	•	Main effects (￼, ￼, etc.) represent the individual contribution of each feature to the model’s output.
	•	Interaction effects (￼, ￼, etc.) represent how pairs (or more) of variables interact to influence the model’s predictions.

Decomposition Conditions:

The decomposition must meet two conditions:

	1.	Main effects and interaction effects should have zero means: This ensures that the model does not have any bias and that the decomposition represents true variable contributions.
	2.	Main effects (￼) and interaction effects (￼) should be orthogonal: Orthogonality ensures that the main and interaction effects are independent of each other, which simplifies the interpretation of their contributions.

Decomposition Methods:

FANOVA decomposition can be done using two primary methods:

	1.	Sobo’s Method (CoE’s Choice):
	•	This method is based on the Global Sensitivity Indices for Nonlinear Mathematical Models Review.
	•	Assumptions: It assumes variable independence and uses the marginal (rather than joint) distribution of the features for integration.
	•	Advantages: It is computationally efficient and relatively easy to implement, making it a practical choice when independence assumptions are reasonable.
	2.	Hooker’s Method:
	•	This method comes from Generalized Functional ANOVA Diagnostics for High Dimensional Functions of Dependent Variables.
	•	Advantages: It does not rely on variable independence assumptions, making it a more flexible approach for models where variables are highly interdependent.
	•	Disadvantages: Hooker’s method is more computationally expensive because it does not make simplifying assumptions, making it less efficient in certain contexts.

Findings:

	•	The validators confirmed that the FANOVA decomposition by the CoE met both of the key conditions (zero means and orthogonality). This means that the decomposition accurately represented the main and interaction effects in the model, allowing for proper interpretation.

Recommendations by MRF:

	•	MRF recommended that the CoE provide a clear rationale for choosing Sobo’s method over Hooker’s method. Since Sobo’s method assumes variable independence, it may not always be the best choice for all models. MRF suggested that CoE could either justify its choice of Sobo’s method or consider using Hooker’s approach in future projects to account for potential dependencies between variables.

Conclusion:

FANOVA decomposition is a powerful tool for explaining model predictions by separating the main effects of individual variables from their interaction effects. While Sobo’s method is computationally efficient, Hooker’s method offers more flexibility in handling dependent variables. The CoE successfully applied FANOVA decomposition, and future work may involve further consideration of the method’s assumptions and applicability.
