3. Results Summary from Tables

Regular Numerical Features (Table 5-5)
	•	Features like time_recent_event_seconds and dvc_max_total_dist_cust show:
	•	Predictable score increase with +3σ shocks.
	•	High sensitivity suggests these features influence fraud score greatly.

Frequency Features (Table 5-6)
	•	Show consistent increasing scores with higher perturbations.
	•	High delta_pos3 values suggest strong influence on risk prediction.

Flag Features (Table 5-7)
	•	Binary indicators show expected increases when flipped to the riskier side.
	•	callactv_flag_last_days_14 increases score by ~23.52%.

Missing Value Analysis (Table 5-8, 5-9)
	•	dig_daily_mult_country_present and time_recent_event_seconds have significant null rates.
	•	Imputation in the risk direction increased prediction scores (up to 13.63%).

4. Key Insights
	•	Smaller delta values indicate robustness; larger values indicate sensitivity and potential model instability.
	•	Perturbation reveals feature vulnerabilities and helps identify features with disproportionate influence.
	•	Null value impact analysis confirms the model’s dependency on complete information for accuracy.
