Scorecard models, widely used in credit risk, fraud detection, and other financial applications, have several disadvantages:
	1.	Limited Predictive Power – Scorecards are typically linear models and may not capture complex, nonlinear relationships in the data as well as machine learning models.
	2.	Manual Feature Selection – The process of selecting and binning variables requires expert judgment and can introduce biases or lead to suboptimal performance.
	3.	Rigid Structure – Since scorecard models use pre-defined bins and weightings, they may not adapt well to changing data patterns or new risk factors.
	4.	Difficult Handling of Interactions – Scorecards do not naturally capture interactions between variables unless explicitly modeled, which can lead to an oversimplified risk assessment.
	5.	Time-Consuming Development – The development process involves extensive data analysis, binning, weight-of-evidence (WOE) transformation, and validation, making it labor-intensive.
	6.	Data Drift Sensitivity – As economic conditions or customer behaviors change, the scorecard model may become outdated, requiring frequent recalibration.
	7.	Lack of Granularity – Binning variables into discrete categories may lead to a loss of information, potentially reducing model accuracy.
	8.	Regulatory Scrutiny – While scorecards are often more interpretable than complex models, they still require rigorous documentation and validation to satisfy regulatory requirements.
	9.	Subjective Weight Assignments – Although scorecards use statistical techniques like logistic regression, the binning process and cut-off selections often involve subjective decision-making.
	10.	Scalability Challenges – While effective for structured credit decisions, scorecards may not scale efficiently to large-scale, high-dimensional datasets compared to advanced machine learning techniques.
