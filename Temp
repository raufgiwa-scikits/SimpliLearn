RE: Letter in Support of Wells Fargo Bank N.A.’s Petition for a National Interest Waiver on behalf of Dr. Rauf Giwa  

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express my strong support for Wells Fargo Bank N.A.’s petition for a National Interest Waiver on behalf of Dr. Rauf Giwa, a highly distinguished Quantitative Analytics Specialist. Dr. Giwa’s exceptional expertise and groundbreaking contributions in the field of mathematical and computational modeling for quantitative analysis in the financial industry are of substantial national importance. His continued work in the United States will greatly benefit the nation, thus justifying the waiver of the labor certification requirement.

Dr. Giwa has made remarkable strides in advancing quantitative analysis through his innovative approaches to mathematical and computational modeling. His work at Wells Fargo has been pivotal in enhancing the robustness and reliability of financial models, which are critical for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial sector. Dr. Giwa’s contributions extend beyond Wells Fargo to the broader U.S. financial landscape, where his work ensures rigorous regulatory compliance, consumer protection, and the prevention of systemic risks.

As the Manager of Decision Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) at Wells Fargo, I have had the privilege of overseeing Dr. Giwa’s work directly. The DSAI division validates models across a range of critical areas, including financial crimes, fair lending, operational risk, marketing, fraud detection, natural language processing (NLP), and credit scoring. Dr. Giwa’s role within this division is integral. He applies his deep expertise to develop and validate models that are essential for the bank’s operations, ensuring they are robust, reliable, and compliant with regulatory standards.

One of Dr. Giwa’s notable contributions is his adaptation of the Functional ANOVA (FANOVA) decomposition procedure for XGBoost models. FANOVA is a statistical method that breaks down and analyzes the variance in model outputs, identifying the contributions of individual variables and their interactions. Dr. Giwa’s enhancements to FANOVA, using Sobol and Hooker's methods, have significantly improved model interpretability and efficiency, making them more reliable and easier to understand. This work is instrumental in simplifying model complexity and enhancing feature selection, thereby improving the overall performance and accuracy of financial models.

Additionally, Dr. Giwa has advanced data robustness testing, a critical aspect of machine learning model validation. He improved the in-house robustness testing procedure by incorporating the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic as a performance metric. The KS statistic measures the distance between empirical distribution functions of two samples, providing a robust means of assessing a model’s ability to distinguish between different outcomes. This enhancement has given our model validation team a valuable tool for examining model calibration and robustness, ensuring higher accuracy and stability in predictive modeling. Dr. Giwa’s work in this area is becoming increasingly urgent as the financial sector’s reliance on artificial intelligence and advanced analytics grows.

The significance of Dr. Giwa’s contributions is underscored by their broad impact on the U.S. financial industry. His work ensures regulatory compliance and consumer protection by adhering to standards set by regulatory bodies such as the United States Federal Reserve and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. His expertise in financial modeling and risk management helps prevent unchecked risk-taking, contributing to the overall stability of both U.S. and global financial systems. Dr. Giwa’s innovative use of advanced data analytics and machine learning technologies maintains the U.S. as a global leader in financial innovation. His role also supports significant employment within the U.S. economy and contributes to professional development by mentoring the next generation of quantitative analysts. Enhancing the accuracy and reliability of financial models boosts investor and consumer confidence, vital for the smooth functioning of financial markets. Moreover, Dr. Giwa’s efforts in advancing the transparency and effectiveness of machine learning models in finance ensure responsible deployment of innovations, fostering trust and widespread adoption.

In conclusion, Dr. Giwa’s extensive academic background and distinguished professional experience in mathematical and computational modeling make him an invaluable asset to Wells Fargo and the broader financial industry. His work is essential for advancing quantitative analysis efforts at Wells Fargo and supporting the financial services sector across the United States. Based on my direct knowledge of Dr. Giwa’s career and contributions, I can affirm that his work is immensely important to the United States, and he is exceptionally well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor. Therefore, I strongly recommend that the National Interest Waiver for Dr. Rauf Giwa be granted, as his contributions significantly benefit the nation and align with the interests of the United States.

Sincerely,

Dr. Nancy He  
Analytics Senior Manager  
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
