+1


Highlight: Reported zero fraud losses in specific case studies (e.g., Guaranty Bank).

Slide 5: SQN Sentry: Robustness & Interpretability

Visual Explainability: Provides side-by-side displays of questioned vs. reference signatures for human review.


Dynamic Thresholding: Adjusts strictness based on user-specific signature consistency (e.g., looser for elderly signers).


Preprocessing: Advanced background removal to isolate ink from complex check watermarks.

Slide 6: Mitek Check Fraud Defender: Architecture

Approach: Multi-Model Ensemble and Cloud-Based Forensics.
+2


Deep Learning: Uses CNNs (like ResNet or EfficientNet) to analyze 18-24 distinct document attributes.
+1


Comparative Logic: Distance Metric Learning (Euclidean or Cosine distance) in high-dimensional feature space.
+1

Slide 7: Mitek: Beyond the Signature

Holistic Forensics: Analyzes handwriting style on payee/amount lines to match the signature style.


Layout Integrity: Compares check templates against "Golden Templates" to detect counterfeits.


Check Liveness: Uses photometric stereo analysis to detect "picture of a picture" replay attacks.

Slide 8: Mitek: Data Advantage & Performance

Scale: Models trained on over 4 billion processed checks.


Intelligence: Scrapes criminal forums and Telegram for "known bad" images to train against emerging threats.


KPIs: 80% accuracy (Hit Rate) and documented $16M in fraud loss avoidance over 5 months for a top-25 bank.
+1

Slide 9: Fiserv OASIS: Integrated Ecosystem

Positioning: Embedded "immune system" within core banking ecosystems (Signature®).
+1


Model: Hybrid Probabilistic Engine combining image processing with supervised machine learning.


Decision Logic: Relies on Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees for high interpretability.

Slide 10: Fiserv: Operational Focus

Scoring: Risk Score (0–1000) tuned to an institution's specific risk appetite.


Throughput: Optimized for high-speed batch processing (thousands of items per second).


Operational Gain: Documented reduction of manual investigation queues by 50% to 70%.
+1

Slide 11: Fiserv: Consortium & Training

FraudNet: Shared intelligence across the Fiserv network to block widespread counterfeit templates.


Dynamic References: Automatically updates user reference profiles as their signatures evolve over time.


Third-Party Integration: Uses Early Warning Services (EWS) for real-time account status.

Slide 12: Parascript SignatureXpert.AI: The "Engineer's Choice"

Approach: Multi-Agent Voting Ensemble utilizing seven distinct verifiers.


XR Technology: Converts raster images into vector-based stroke elements ("XR Elements").


Advantage: Uniquely capable of detecting "skilled forgeries" (tracings) where stroke flow is unnatural despite pixel accuracy.
+1

Slide 13: Parascript: Training & Robustness

Loss Functions: Utilizes Contrastive or Triplet Loss to minimize distance between genuine pairs.


One-Shot Learning: Capable of verification with as few as one reference image.


Technical Edge: Robust at low resolution (100 DPI) and best-in-class background elimination.

Slide 14: Parascript: Market Performance

Accuracy: 98%–99% on high-quality images; exceeds human forensic experts in Vote-by-Mail testing.


Speed: Verifies 100+ signatures per second per server core.


Use Cases: De facto standard for election signature verification and high-value banking.

Parascript: "Glass Box" vector analysis; explains failure based on specific graphemes (e.g., "Loop structure inconsistent").

Slide 18: System Weaknesses

SQN: Offline verification struggles with highly skilled tracings.


Mitek: Cloud dependency and potential "Black Box" complexity of deep learning scores.


Fiserv: Legacy image engines may be less effective against deepfakes compared to AI-first vendors.
+1


Parascript: High integration complexity as an SDK/API; requires significant engineering effort.

Slide 19: Strategic Recommendations

For High-Speed Batch/Core Integration: Choose Fiserv for its native ecosystem and "Whole Check" forensics.
